# 5. How to deliver a CSRF exploit

🛡️ **Overview:**

The delivery mechanisms for **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)** attacks are essentially the same as those used in **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**.

### 🕸️ **How CSRF Attacks Are Delivered**

🚨 **Step-by-step:**

- The attacker places **malicious HTML** onto a website they control.
- They then **induce victims** to visit that website, typically through:
    - ✉️ Email
    - 🌐 Social media messages

📌 **Alternative vector:**

If the malicious HTML is injected into a **popular website** (e.g., via a user comment), the attacker may simply **wait for users to visit**.

---

### 🔗 **Simple CSRF Exploits via GET Method**

🧩 Some basic CSRF attacks use the **GET method** and can be **self-contained** in a single URL.

In these cases, an external malicious site **may not be necessary**.

✅ **Example Scenario:**

If a request to change an email address can be made using GET, a self-contained attack could look like this:

```html
<img src="https://vulnerable-website.com/email/change?email=pwned@evil-user.net">
```

👁️‍🗨️ In this case, just embedding the above `<img>` tag on any webpage would trigger the action **without any user interaction**.

🔐 **Stay Secure!**

Understanding these mechanisms is key to defending against CSRF vulnerabilities. Always validate actions, use anti-CSRF tokens, and avoid using GET for state-changing operations.
