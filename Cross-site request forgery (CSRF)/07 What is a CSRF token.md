# 7. What is a CSRF token?

🔐 A **CSRF token** is a **unique, secret, and unpredictable** value that is generated by the **server-side application** and shared with the **client**.

✉️ When issuing a request to perform a **sensitive action**, such as submitting a form, the client must include the **correct CSRF token**.

🚫 Otherwise, the server will **refuse** to perform the requested action.

---

### 📤 **How CSRF Tokens Are Shared**

A common way to share CSRF tokens with the client is to include them as a **hidden parameter in an HTML form**.

Here’s an example:

```html
<form name="change-email-form" action="/my-account/change-email" method="POST">
	<label>Email</label>
	<input required type="email" name="email" [value="example@normal-website.com](mailto:value=%22example@normal-website.com)">
	<input required type="hidden" name="csrf" value="50FaWgdOhi9M9wyna8taR1k3ODOR8d6u">
	<button class='button' type='submit'> Update email </button>
</form>
```

🛠️ In this example:

- The **email input** is visible and required.
- The **CSRF token** is hidden and ensures secure request validation.
- The **submit button** initiates the action only if the token is correct.

---

🔐 **Remember:** CSRF tokens are a cornerstone of secure web applications — always validate them on the server side!

### 📤 **Resulting Request on Form Submission**

```
POST /my-account/change-email HTTP/1.1
Host: normal-website.com
Content-Length: 70
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

csrf=50FaWgdOhi9M9wyna8taR1k3ODOR8d6u&email=example@normal-website.com
```

### ✅ **Effectiveness of CSRF Tokens**

When implemented **correctly**, CSRF tokens help protect against CSRF attacks by making it **difficult for an attacker to construct a valid request** on behalf of the victim.

🔒 As the attacker has **no way of predicting** the correct CSRF token, they **won’t be able to include it** in their malicious request.

---

### 📌 **Note**

> CSRF tokens **don’t have to be sent** as hidden parameters in a POST request. Some applications place CSRF tokens in **HTTP headers**, for example. The method of transmission significantly impacts the **security of the mechanism** as a whole. For more information, see **How to prevent CSRF vulnerabilities**.
