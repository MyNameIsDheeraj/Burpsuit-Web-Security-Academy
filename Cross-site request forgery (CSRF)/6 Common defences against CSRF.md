# 6. Common defences against CSRF

🔍 Nowadays, successfully finding and exploiting **CSRF vulnerabilities** often involves **bypassing anti-CSRF measures** deployed by the target website, the victim's browser, or both.

---

### 🚧 **Common CSRF Defenses You May Encounter**

---

### 🎟️ **CSRF Tokens**

> A CSRF token is a unique, secret, and unpredictable value that is generated by the server-side application and shared with the client.
> 

🧾 When attempting to perform a **sensitive action**, such as submitting a form, the client must include the **correct CSRF token** in the request.

🔐 This makes it **very difficult for an attacker** to construct a valid request on behalf of the victim.

---

### 🍪 **Same Site Cookies**

> Same Site is a browser security mechanism that determines when a website's cookies are included in requests originating from other websites.
> 

🗝️ As requests to perform sensitive actions typically require an **authenticated session cookie**, the appropriate Same Site restrictions may prevent an attacker from triggering these actions **cross-site**.

📆 **Since 2021**, Chrome enforces **Lax Same Site restrictions** by default. As this is the proposed standard, we expect other major browsers to **adopt this behavior** in the future.

---

### 🌐 **Referer-Based Validation**

> Some applications use the HTTP Referer header to attempt to defend against CSRF attacks, usually by verifying that the request originated from the application’s own domain.
> 

⚠️ This is generally **less effective** than CSRF token validation.

🔐 **Tip:** Combine multiple defenses whenever possible for stronger protection against CSRF.
