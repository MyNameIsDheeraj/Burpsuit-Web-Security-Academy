---

### üéØ **Goal**

Perform a cross-site scripting attack that injects a vector which, when clicked, calls the `alert` function.

> Important:
> 
> 
> You need to label your vector with the word **"Click"** to induce the simulated lab user to click it. For example:
> 
> ```jsx
> <a href="">Click me</a>
> ```
