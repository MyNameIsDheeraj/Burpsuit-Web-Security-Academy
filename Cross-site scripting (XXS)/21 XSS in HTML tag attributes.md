# 21. XSS in HTML tag attributes

### ðŸ§ª Attribute-Based Injection Techniques

When the **XSS context is inside an HTML tag's attribute value**, there are a few ways to exploit it.

---

### ðŸ”“ Terminate the Attribute and Inject a Script Tag

In some cases, you can **terminate the attribute**, **close the tag**, and **introduce a new script tag**:

```jsx
"><script>alert(document.domain)</script>
```

### ðŸ§± Bypassing Angle Bracket Restrictions with Event Handlers

Often, **angle brackets (`< >`) are blocked or encoded**, so you **canâ€™t break out of the tag**. But if you can terminate the attribute value, you can inject a **new attribute** that creates a scriptable context:

```jsx
" autofocus onfocus=alert(document.domain) x="
```

This payload does the following:

- âœ… Creates an `onfocus` event to execute JavaScript when the element receives focus
- âœ… Adds the `autofocus` attribute to **automatically trigger `onfocus`**
- âœ… Appends `x="` to **gracefully repair** any following markup

---

### ðŸš€ Script Execution via Scriptable Attributes

Sometimes, the context is inside an attribute that **already supports script execution**, like the `href` attribute of an anchor tag.

In this case, you **donâ€™t need to close the attribute**, just use a **scriptable protocol**:

```jsx
<a href="javascript:alert(document.domain)">
```

### ðŸŽ® Exploiting Attributes in Non-Scriptable Tags Using Access Keys

You may encounter sites that **encode angle brackets but still allow attribute injection** â€” even in tags that **donâ€™t typically fire events**, like:

```jsx
<link rel="canonical" href="..." accesskey="x" onfocus=...>
```

âœ… **Access keys** allow you to bind elements to keyboard shortcuts

âœ… Combined with **`onfocus`**, this can lead to XSS â€” **even in hidden or passive tags**
